## Introduction

This repository includes code and supplementary resources for the chapters in the book, covering topics such as:
- Fundamentals of XGBoost and its application in predictive modeling
- Techniques for time series forecasting with XGBoost
- Feature engineering, interpretability, and model deployment
- Practical examples using real-world datasets for hands-on learning

This repository serves as a companion to the book, helping practitioners and researchers deepen their understanding of XGBoost.

## Setup and Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies listed in the `xgboostenv.yml` file.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/XGBoost-for-Regression-Predictive-Modeling-and-Time-Series-Analysis.git
cd XGBoost-for-Regression-Predictive-Modeling-and-Time-Series-Analysis
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate the Conda Environment

Use the provided Conda environment file to set up the required dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f xgboostenv.yml
conda activate xgboostenv
```

This environment will install all necessary libraries, including XGBoost, scikit-learn, and other dependencies required to run the code in this repository.

### Chapter-Specific Environment for Chapter 10

Please note that **Chapter 10** has additional or specific dependencies that require a separate environment setup. Follow the instructions in the `ch10` folder's README or setup script to create and activate this specialized environment.

## Repository Structure

Each chapter directory (`ch2`, `ch4`, etc.) corresponds to a chapter in the book and contains the relevant code and datasets.

- `ch2`, `ch4`, `ch5`, ... : Chapter directories with practical examples and exercises
- `ch10`: Contains additional setup instructions specific to Chapter 10, please refer to Chapter10_Environment_Setup_Instructions.txt file for setting up  the python enviroment
- `xgboostenv.yml`: Conda environment file for installing dependencies for most chapters
- `LICENSE`: License information for the repository

## Usage

Each chapter's code can be executed individually. Here’s how to get started:

1. Navigate to the desired chapter folder:
   ```bash
   cd ch2
   ```

2. Run the scripts or Jupyter notebooks within the folder to follow along with the book’s examples.

### Example

For a quick example of running the code in Chapter 2:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in `ch2`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ch2/notebook_name.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells to see the results and experiment with the parameters.
