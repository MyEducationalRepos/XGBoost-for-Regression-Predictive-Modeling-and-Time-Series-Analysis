# Environment Setup Instructions for Chapter 10

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Python environment required to run the Chapter 10 code on model interpretability, including the use of `xgboost`, `sklearn`, `lime`, `shap`, `eli5`, `numpy`, and other dependencies.

## Requirements

1. **Mambaforge**: This setup uses Mambaforge, which includes a base Python environment.
2. **.yaml file**: The `model_interpretability_env.yaml` file specifies the required dependencies and their versions to avoid compatibility issues.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Install Mambaforge

1. Download the installer:
   - [Mambaforge-24.9.0-0-Windows-x86_64.exe](link_to_the_exe)
2. Run the `.exe` file as an administrator to install Mambaforge.

#### Step 2: Create the Python Environment

1. Open a terminal (or Anaconda prompt if available).
2. Run the following commands to create and activate the environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f model_interpretability_env.yaml
   conda activate xgboost_book_model_interpretability
   ```

   - Ensure that the `model_interpretability_env.yaml` file is in the current directory.

#### Step 3: Launch Jupyter Lab

1. Once the environment is active, you can launch Jupyter Lab by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. Open the Chapter 10 notebook and ensure that all dependencies load correctly.

---

After following these instructions, verify that the environment works as expected. Once confirmed, this `.yaml` file will be added to the repository for future use.
